10/8: In the past week I have created a pretty simple website where I can have links to all of my little projects. I have created my first didie, called Highlights Page. Pretty much I have a bunch of athletes on a page and when you click on them it show the highlights. I am currently trying to make it so that the links only work when you click on the images.
</p>
<p>

10/24: I have been brainstorming for my Ocean website and I have finally decided on an idea. I have made a couple mock-ups and after talking to the Kindergardeners I am going to make a website where you can scroll down and look at different fish at different depths of the ocean. When you hover on the fish it will display information about it. I am also looking to continue working on my Highlights Page idea and hopefully find a way to make the link only work when you press on the athlete. I have a lab on Monday to hopefully make that happen. 
</p>
<p>

10/30: I have been working on my room sketch and I have a lab today to start my ocean project. I need some help with my project and I want to hopefully have a backround by the end of the lab. This is going to be my #1 prioriy for the next couple of weeks and I will make more labs to complete the website.
</p>

11/19: I have made alot of progress on my Ocean Project and I now have an ocean with coresponding gradients to actual light in the sea. I have also put in divs for all of my fish and created a menu at the top of the website so that you don't have to scroll all the way down. My next step is to give the divs a background image so that it looks like a fish. I am realy excited to finish this project.

11/25: After reading "JavaScript for Cats" I learned alot about JavaScript and how I can apply it to my projects. The "function" section was especially helpful because I will be able to use this in my projects and I already have in my "baseball.html" project. This is something that can be applied to alot of different websites and "JavaScript for Cats" helped me understand it more. 
</p>
<p>
1/31: I helped the new kids make there person cards and I am excited to start my "Gist" project. I am planning on making a Clemson vs. LSU football page with Trevor Lawrence's head popping up everywhere. I plan on having a working version by the end of the weekend.
</p>
<p>
2/3: I have a working version of my "gist" project and it looks really cool. I need to figure out how to get the big blue dojt out of the middle and I want to meet with you about that. I am pushing my website and as of now all of my projects should be up to date. I want to also finish my ocean project as well as finishing up my Gists. 
</p>
<p>
2/4: I have made a new website! It is much cleaner than the other one and it has GIF's as links to my porjects. I will continue to work on my Trevor Lawrence Gist project aswell.
