10/8: In the past week I have created a pretty simple website where I can have links to all of my little projects. I have created my first didie, called Highlights Page. Pretty much I have a bunch of athletes on a page and when you click on them it show the highlights. I am currently trying to make it so that the links only work when you click on the images.

10/24: I have been brainstorming for my Ocean website and I have finally decided on an idea. I have made a couple mock-ups and after talking to the Kindergardeners I am going to make a website where you can scroll down and look at different fish at different depths of the ocean. When you hover on the fish it will display information about it. I am also looking to continue working on my Highlights Page idea and hopefully find a way to make the link only work when you press on the athlete. I have a lab on Monday to hopefully make that happen.
